# Welcome, Indianapolis Pythoneers!

Meet other local Python Programming Language enthusiasts!

## What is this repository?

I'll stuff any quick presentations we do during the meetings here so members can have quick access to them.

You can view the presentations as text, but most were created with [Landslide][1] in mind. To generate an HTML presentation, run

    landslide -l no file_name.md

Enjoy!
